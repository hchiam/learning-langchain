# Learning [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com)

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com) is [basically a convenience high-level library to do a bunch of LLM stuff in few lines of code](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/13895ru/what_is_langchain/?rdt=41058). You can do things like [generate and execute SQL queries from natural language text prompts in Python](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) or in [JavaScript](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/popular/sqlite).
